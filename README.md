# CubicDB

Â¿Are you looking for a speedcubing application?

You're in the right place. This is a complete speedcubing application that gathers all kind of resources for you. More than a speedcubing app, this is a cubing guide.

## Features

### Tutorials
This is the first section. Here you can find some basic tutorials but please be patiente, there will be more over time.

### Algorithms
Basically, this is a copy of [AlgDB](https://algdb.net). Here you can find a lot of methods and sub-methods with all the possible casses and algorithms that you'll ever learn. This is a huge database.

### Timer
Party is comming. This section allows you to sharp your skills by timing your solves and track your progress. For that, you will count with a lot of resources like statistics, all kind of charts and options.

You can input your times with three (3) different methods:
* Keyboard: Using the space bar to start and stop the timer.
* Manual: By using an external timer and writing the time by hand.
* Stackmat: You can connect a stackmat and use it to handle the timer.

Some of the options are:
* Reload scramble.
* Write your own scramble (it understand conmutator notation or repeating patterns, like: R U [F, R] L (D B)2).
* Use again one of the previous scrambles.
* Copy scramble to clipboard.
* Set the inspection time, show or hide time when running and more.
* Select the method for compute the statistics (Sequential or in groups).

### PLL Recognition
Here you can train your 1-Look PLL. It will show you some random PLL and track the time to answer for each answer.

### Puzzle Simulator
Do you want to try a puzzle before buying it, or just want to play with one of them? Here you will have a good amount of puzzles and surprise, there will be more and more.

### Settings
There are not too much global settings here, but at least you can select the font of the application and the timer.

### Import-Export
If you use Twisty Timer, CSTimer or CubeDesk and want to import your data, this is the right place. You can select the sessions that you want to import.

### Contest
This section is not available for now, but will be in premium version. The purpose is simple: to generate PDF sheets for a contest and track all the times, sort them and more.
