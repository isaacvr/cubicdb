## Features

### Tutorials

This is the first section. Here you can find some basic tutorials but please be patiente, there will be more over time.

### Algorithms

Here you can find a lot of methods and sub-methods with all the possible casses and algorithms that you'll ever learn. This is a huge database.

### Timer

Party is comming. This section allows you to sharp your skills by timing your solves and track your progress. For that, you will count with a lot of resources like statistics, all kind of charts and options.

You can input your times with three (3) different methods:

- Keyboard: Using the space bar to start and stop the timer.
- Manual: By using an external timer and writing the time by hand.
- Stackmat: You can connect a stackmat and use it to handle the timer.
- Smart cube: You can connect a smart cube in order to control the timer. Not every smart cube is available, but we can guarantee that the GAN iCarry it's going to work.

Some of the options are:

- Reload scramble.
- Write your own scramble (it understand conmutator notation or repeating patterns, like: R U [F, R] L (D B)2).
- Use again one of the previous scrambles.
- Copy scramble to clipboard.
- Set the inspection time, show or hide time when running and more.
- Select the method for compute the statistics (Sequential or in groups).
- Set a "seed" and a number, to sync your scrambles with a friend without needing internet connection.

### PLL Recognition

Here you can train your 1-Look PLL. It will show you some random PLL and track the time to answer for each answer.

### Puzzle Simulator

Do you want to try a puzzle before buying it, or just want to play with one of them? Here you will have a good amount of puzzles and surprise, there will be more and more.

### Settings

There are not too much global settings here, but at least you can select the font of the application and the timer.

### Import/Export function

If you use Twisty Timer, CSTimer or CubeDesk and want to import your data, this is the right place. You can select the sessions that you want to import.

### Contest

This section is not available for now, but will be in premium version. The purpose is simple: to generate PDF sheets for a contest and track all the times, sort them and more.
