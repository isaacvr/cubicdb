Now you have to practice all the algorithms until your hand knows them better. With this method you can do really good times, but you will have to focus on the important things. Don't try to be super fast, because it can affect your hability to see what's next on a reasonable time. Try to do only the required moves and avoid rotations of the cube.\n\nOnce you have stability using this method, you can learn the full version of it. There's no need for tutorials, since the method remains the same. The only difference is that the full version doesn't reduce to a subset of the algorithms, but it has all of them. It seems like a big challenge, but you can do it. All the algorithms are on the Algorithms section of CubeDB. Hope you can enjoy them.\n\nBest of luck!"}]}],"summary":"Reduced version of CFOP.
